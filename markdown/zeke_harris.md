## Cruise Automation

**Site Reliability Engineer/Tech Lead/Manager**

_11/2015 – 11/2021_

At Cruise I did whatever was necessary to help the business grow.
This encompassed many different tasks, from real estate scouting to
building multi-petabyte storage systems and more.

* Led technical side of multiple office and datacenter build-outs (often the first Cruise employee on-site)
* Designed and built multiple iterations of:
  * Scale-out data storage (terabytes to petabytes)
  * Data transfer from vehicles to storage, ultimately leading to transferring hundreds of terabytes from dozens of vehicles multiple times per day
  * Compute for systems including internal tools and AI training
* Introduced DataDog to Cruise
  * Trained teams on how to add monitoring and logging to their products
  * Served as direct point of contact with DataDog
* Produced and provided training for incident response and blameless postmortems
* Led newly formed Observability team
* Selected and deployed cost-effective large-scale logging platform after DataDog became too expensive

## Twitter

**Site Reliability Engineer**

_07/2012 – 11/2015_

At Twitter I worked with the Developer Productivity team and later the Aurora/Mesos team, starting as a Software Engineer and later becoming an SRE.

* Improved testing user experience at every step of the process
  * Decreased build times by caching artifacts
  * Increased massive test parallel execution
  * Improved Pants build tool
* Automated deployment of Jenkins workers, allowing dynamic test scaling
* Deployed additional Artifactory servers, improving artifact caching retrieval speed and increasing reliability
* Automated repair lifecycle of Aurora/Mesos nodes, including allowing long-lived jobs time to migrate to new hosts and warm up caches before evicting from nodes needing maintenance
